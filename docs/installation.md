# Installation

## Stable release

To install dike, run this command in your terminal:

``` console
$ pip install dike
```

This is the preferred method to install dike, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

the [Github repo][].

You can either clone the public repository:

```

Or download the [tarball][]:
